# array.groupBy()

## Introduction
The `array.groupBy()` method is used to group elements of an array based on a given function. It returns an object where the keys are the result of the grouping function, and the values are arrays containing the elements that correspond to each key.

## Syntax
```javascript
array.groupBy(callbackFn)
```

### Parameters
- `callbackFn`: A function that accepts up to three arguments. The `groupBy()` method calls the `callbackFn` function once for each element in the array.

### Return value
An object where each key is the result of the `callbackFn` function, and the corresponding value is an array of elements from the original array that produced that result.

## Description
The `groupBy()` method executes the provided `callbackFn` function once for each element in the array. It then groups the array elements according to the returned values from the `callbackFn`.


## Notes
- The `groupBy()` method is a relatively new addition to JavaScript and may not be supported in all environments. Check for compatibility before using it in production.
- If you need to support older environments, you can achieve similar functionality using `reduce()` or other array methods.
