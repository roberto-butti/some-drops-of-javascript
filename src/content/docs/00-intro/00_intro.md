## The reason why
This book collects useful, unknown, or underrated JavaScript functions or things discovered, used, and learned during daily JavaScript use.

When using JavaScript frameworks/libraries daily (like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte), sometimes one can lose sight of the language's power and the basic functionalities provided by the JavaScript core.
I see that I usually look at the framework documentation or find a package in NPM for the system, array, and string functions instead of using the core functionalities provided by the language.

While I wrote this HTML book, I also wrote some scripts to better understand the functions' behavior. You can find these examples here: https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-javascript in the _examples_ directory.

### Requirements

The code used in this book is tested with **Bun (latest)** and **Node.js (LTS)**.

**Bun** is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner built from scratch using the Zig programming language. Jarred Sumner designed it as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. Bun uses JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine, unlike Node.js and Deno, which both use V8. The official website is: https://bun.sh/ .

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. You can obtain it on the official https://nodejs.org/ website.


### Continuous release

I was thinking of printing this book, but I think it is not eco-friendly, and a book about development could be improved daily regarding spellchecking, content, and examples. I expect to adopt the same approach in the software with the CI/CD, with a continuous release of the book.

Releases:

- **W.I.P.** the 1.0.0 version has not yet been released: writing... ;

> The book is a Work in Progress, and the list of currently covered functions is in the [list-of-functions.md](list-of-functions.md) file
